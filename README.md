# New_York_City_Fire_Incident_Dispatch_Data 
 
In this project, we are looking at the New York City Fire Incident Dispatch Data from the NYC Open data. We want to gain some beneficial insights from the data through the use of data analysis.  
We will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to upload the data from the NYC open data website onto Elasticsearch and then develop visuals through Kibana. 
The aim of this project is to help NYC citizens, New York Fire Department and New York Police Department to understand the fire incidents in NYC and generate viable solutions.
